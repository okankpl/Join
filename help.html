        </p>

        <h2 class="privacy-h2">What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="color-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of 
          dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, 
          limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="color-blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of 
          kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
          It is important to note that <span class="color-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for 
          extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, 
          we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span class="color-blue">Join</span>.

        <h2 class="privacy-h2">How to use it</h2>

          <h2>1.</h2>
          <div>
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>When you log in to <span class="color-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board 
                  represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", 
                  "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
          </div>

        <div class="explain-box">
          <h2>2.</h2>
          <div>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>In <span class="color-blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" 
                  section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, 
                  these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="explain-box">
          <h2>3.</h2>
          <div>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent 
                  individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new 
                  card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, 
                  assignees, etc.

        <div class="explain-box">
          <h2>4.</h2>
          <div>
              <h3>Moving Cards </h3>
              <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging 
                  and dropping the card from one list to another.
              </p>
          </div>

        <div class="explain-box">
          <h2>5.</h2>
          <div>
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done list or delete it. Deleting"
                  a Card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                  as this is irreversible.
